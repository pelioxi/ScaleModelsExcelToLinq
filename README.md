ASP.NET Reading Excel file with Linq (Somehow) based on Michiel Wouters YouTube Tutorial (https://github.com/MichWouters). Perfect done, Michiel. And thank you very much for your work. Uses .NET FRAMEWORK 4.5 and Entity Framework 6.4.4 just for User's control. It reads .XLS as well as .XLSX Excel File Format. Reads just one Excel sheet data as it were stored in a SQL database, refreshing dropdownlists every time in order to get the right data when one of them (3) changes selection. Some rows has its ID (Scale18) column empty. There is just one model to see pics if you select Collection: FERRARI, Brand: Ferrari, Maker: MATTEL
